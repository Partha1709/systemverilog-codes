SystemVerilog Codes Repository:

Welcome to my SystemVerilog codes repository! This collection includes all the SystemVerilog codes I have practiced throughout my journey as a Design Verification Engineer,
as well as during my college years. These resources were requested by a fellow VLSI enthusiast, and I hope they prove helpful to others in the field.

Feel free to explore, use, and learn from these codes. If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvements, please let me know.

Happy learning!
